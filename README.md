__________________________________________

This font is a superset of, and was inspired by, the maze lettering used
in some trailers and posters for the 2010 movie "Inception" by Christopher Nolan. 

You should feel welcome to modify this font, as long as I am still credited
in the copyright of the font. I say "MIT license", but I basically mean
"Do anything interesting you want; just stay respectful, nothing stupid."

## Methodology

Tools used: Inkscape, FontForge

This font, like its inspiration, is based off Gotham Black, which is not
a free font (and therefore not included in the source, so that it remains
a legal fair-use derivative).

I took the original letters in Inkscape, overlaid them with 155px strokes.
Then, I turned these stroked letters into concentric regions with wall
widths of 20px and spaces of 25px. On top of these, I added short strokes
to change the letters into mazes, and merged these into the shapes.
These were then imported into FontForge with an attempt to preserve
letter spacing.

The first version of the font has only 26 uppercase letters. There is
room for improvement:

* Cleaning up the curved letters.
* Adding lowercase letters and/or other characters.
* Creating fonts with different wall widths (using Inset in Inkscape) and font variants (italic, etc.).
* Automating parts of the creation process, including letter creation, modification and font synthesis.
* Various alternate mazes for each letter.
